# status

needs testing.  really could use the opinion on the crypto from
someone with more experience in this area.  haven't done performance
tests.


# intro

this is cryptfile, an encrypted block file served over styx.
for more information, see the manual page, cryptfile(4).


# download

see http://www.ueber.net/code/r/cryptfile for instructions.


# install

change the "mkconfig" if you don't have $ROOT set.  now "mk" to
compile and "mk install" to install the files.

when building from within inferno, insert SYSHOST=Inferno and ROOT=
in the mk invocations to override the values in the mkconfig.

# todo:

- after a "forget" the user enters a password.  if it is wrong, the
  styx read/write on the file fails.  this might upset file servers
  such as kfs much.  perhaps it is better not to respond to the styx
  request until the user enters a correct password.
- add option to change the password (but keep the key of course).
  involves making a new salt, deriving a new key, making a new iv and
  making a new crypted data (with new random cookie, the same key and
  the calculated sha1).
