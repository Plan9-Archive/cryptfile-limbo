# status

usable.  haven't done performance tests.  really could use the
opinion on the crypto from someone with more experience in this
area.


# intro

this is cryptfile, an encrypted block file served over styx.
for more information, see the manual page, cryptfile(4).


# download

see http://www.ueber.net/code/r/cryptfile for instructions.


# install

first, ensure a "mkconfig" file is present.  a bind/symlink to the
mkconfig of your inferno install should do.  now "mk" to compile
and "mk install" to install the files.


# licence & author

# todo:

- after a "forget" the user enters a password.  if it is wrong, the
  styx read/write on the file fails.  this might upset file servers
  such as kfs much.  perhaps it is better not to respond to the styx
  request until the user enters a correct password.
